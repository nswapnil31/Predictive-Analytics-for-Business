### Project 8 :Capstone Project

#### Overview

The capstone project has three main tasks,
each of which requires you to use skills you developed during the
nanodegree program. Once you complete all three tasks, please submit the
project as a PDF.

#### Task 1 Business Problem

Your company currently has 85 grocery stores and is planning to open 10 new stores at the beginning of the year. Currently, all stores use the same store format for selling their products. Up until now, the company has treated all stores similarly, shipping the same amount of product to each store. This is beginning to cause problems as stores are suffering from product surpluses in some product categories and shortages in others. You've been asked to provide analytical support to make decisions about store formats and inventory planning.

#### Task 2 Business Problem

The grocery store chain has 10 new stores opening up at the beginning of the year. The company wants to determine which store format each of the new stores should have. However, we don’t have sales data for these new stores yet, so we’ll have to determine the format using each of the new store’s demographic data.

#### Task 3 Business Problem

Fresh produce has a short life span, and due to increasing costs, the company wants to have an accurate monthly sales forecast.

Tips Split up your Alteryx workflows: You will be using multiple data
sources and complex tools, which can slow down the workflow runtime.
Splitting up the workflows makes the process more manageable. 

Map out your work: Before you dive into your analysis, think about the steps and
plan ahead. This will reduce the amount of unnecessary work. 

Use visualizations: Include visualizations to help explain your decisions
and communicate your findings. Remember what you learned about making
them look great!
